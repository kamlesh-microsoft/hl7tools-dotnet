An HL7 message uses field MSH-18 Character Set to specify the character set(s) in use. Valid values for this field are specified in HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets. MSH-18 Character Set may be left blank, or may contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value may also be explicitly specified as ASCII.

More than one character set may be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 must indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18-character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used.
The repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section 2.7.2, ""Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets"".

Any encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, may be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18 Character Set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites shall document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message.

By using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system.

Note: When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons should be done on character values, not their byte equivalents. For this reason, delimiter characters should always have representation in the standard 7-bit ASCII character set, regardless of the actual character set being used, so that a search for the character CR (carriage return) can be performed.
   a) if the field is not valued, the default single-byte character set (ASCII (""ISO IR6"")) should be assumed. No other character sets are allowed in the message.
   b) if the field repeats, but the first element is NULL (i.e., present but unvalued), the single-byte ASCII (""ISO IR6"") is assumed as the default character set.
   c) elements in the remainder of the sequence (i.e., elements 2..n) are alternate character sets that may be used.",

As with the Sending/Receiving Responsible Organization, the Sending Network Address provides a more detailed picture of the source of the message. This information is lower than the application layer, but is often useful/necessary for routing and identification purposes. This field should only be populated when the underlying communication protocol does not support identification of sending network locations.

An agreement about the specific values and usage must exist among messaging partners. Use Case:

Dr. Hippocrates works for the ''Good Health Clinic"" (Sending facility) with a laptop running application XYZ (Sending App). He needs to talk to the provincial pharmacy system. He dials in and is assigned a network address. He then sends a message to the pharmacy system, which transmits a response back to him. Because the underlying network protocol does not have a place to communicate the sender and receiver network addresses, it therefore requires these addresses to be present in a known position in the payload.

There may be many doctors running application XYZ. In addition, the network address assigned to the laptop may change with each dial-in. This means there is not a 1..1 association between either the facility or the application and the network address.

Example 1: The Lone Tree Island satellite clinic transmits a notification of patient registration to its parent organization Community Health and Hospitals. The communication protocol does not support the identification of sending network location, so the sending network location is identified in the message by using its enterprise-wide network identifier ""HNO2588"".

Example 2: The Stone Mountain satellite clinic transmits a notification of patient registration to its parent organization Community Health and Hospitals. The sending network location is identified by using its URI.

Example 3: The Three Rivers satellite clinic transmits a notification of patient registration to its parent organization Community Health and Hospitals.

            Description = @"This field contains the character set for the entire message. Refer to HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets for valid values.

An HL7 message uses field MSH-18 Character Set to specify the character set(s) in use. Valid values for this field are specified in HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets. MSH-18 Character Set may be left blank, or may contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value may also be explicitly specified as ASCII.

More than one character set may be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 must indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18-character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used.
The repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section 2.7.2, ""Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets"".

Any encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, may be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18 Character Set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites shall document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message.

By using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system.

Note: When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons should be done on character values, not their byte equivalents. For this reason, delimiter characters should always have representation in the standard 7-bit ASCII character set, regardless of the actual character set being used, so that a search for the character CR (carriage return) can be performed.
   a) if the field is not valued, the default single-byte character set (ASCII (""ISO IR6"")) should be assumed. No other character sets are allowed in the message.
   b) if the field repeats, but the first element is NULL (i.e., present but unvalued), the single-byte ASCII (""ISO IR6"") is assumed as the default character set.
   c) elements in the remainder of the sequence (i.e., elements 2..n) are alternate character sets that may be used.",

Repetition of this field allows more flexibility in creating and naming message profiles. Using repetition, this field can identify a set of message profiles that the message conforms to. For example, the first repetition could reference a vendor's message profile. The second could reference another compatible provider's profile or a later version of the first vendor profile.

As of v2.5, the HL7 message profile identifiers might be used for conformance claims and/or publish/subscribe systems. Refer to sections 2B.1.1""Message profile identifier"" and 2.B.1.2, ""Message profile publish/subscribe topics"" for details of the message profile identifiers. Refer to sections 2.B.4.1, ""Static definition identifier"" and 2.B.4.2, ""Static definition publish/subscribe topics"" for details of the static definition identifiers.

Currently, MSH provides fields to transmit both sending/receiving applications and facilities (MSH.3 – MSH.6). However, these levels of organization do not necessarily relate to or imply a legal entity such as a business organization. As such, multiple legal entities (organizations) may share a service bureau, with the same application and facility identifiers. Another level of detail is required to delineate the various organizations using the same service bureau.

Therefore, the Sending Responsible Organization field provides a complete picture from the application level to the overall business level. The Business Organization represents the legal entity responsible for the contents of the message.

Use Case #1: A centralized system responsible for recording and monitoring instances of communicable diseases enforces a stringent authentication protocol with external applications that have been certified to access its information base. In order to allow message exchange, the centralized system mandates that external applications must provide the identity of the business organization sending the message (Sending Responsible Organization), the organization it is sending the message to (Receiving Responsible Organization, in this case the ""owner"" of the communicable diseases system), the network address from which the message has originated (Sending Network Address), the network address the message is being transmitted to (Receiving Network Address). The organization responsible for protecting the information stored within the communicable disease system requires this authentication due to the sensitive nature of the information it contains.",

As with the Sending/Receiving Responsible Organization, the Sending Network Address provides a more detailed picture of the source of the message. This information is lower than the application layer, but is often useful/necessary for routing and identification purposes. This field should only be populated when the underlying communication protocol does not support identification of sending network locations.

An agreement about the specific values and usage must exist among messaging partners. Use Case:

Dr. Hippocrates works for the ''Good Health Clinic"" (Sending facility) with a laptop running application XYZ (Sending App). He needs to talk to the provincial pharmacy system. He dials in and is assigned a network address. He then sends a message to the pharmacy system, which transmits a response back to him. Because the underlying network protocol does not have a place to communicate the sender and receiver network addresses, it therefore requires these addresses to be present in a known position in the payload.

There may be many doctors running application XYZ. In addition, the network address assigned to the laptop may change with each dial-in. This means there is not a 1..1 association between either the facility or the application and the network address.

Example 1: The Lone Tree Island satellite clinic transmits a notification of patient registration to its parent organization Community Health and Hospitals. The communication protocol does not support the identification of sending network location, so the sending network location is identified in the message by using its enterprise-wide network identifier ""HNO2588"".

Example 2: The Stone Mountain satellite clinic transmits a notification of patient registration to its parent organization Community Health and Hospitals. The sending network location is identified by using its URI.

Example 3: The Three Rivers satellite clinic transmits a notification of patient registration to its parent organization Community Health and Hospitals. The sending network location is identified by using its Ipv4 address, port 5123 at node 25.152.27.69.
